Hi, I will begin with the more simple concepts and features of the different methods of declaring/creating a variable and then transition into the more complex aspects of them.
I do not mean the same thing when I say declare or create. This will become aparent through out the video.
These are the four way to create variables in JavaScript. 
You will notice on line four that foo is being created without a keyword, this is discouraged, and I will get into more detail as to why later on in the video.
The var keyword is the original decleration keyword, and has function scope; I will get into the finer details of scope later on.
Variables declared with var can be redeclared using the var keyword, and they can be reassigned as well.
To be reassigned means to change the value of an already exsiting variable without redeclaring it. 
To be declared means to use one of the three decleration keywords at the beginning of the line.
This is one of the reasons to avoid creating a variable without a decleration keyword as that is identical to reassigning an already declared variable.
let and const are the newest ways of declaring a variable, and provide a more rigid syntax as well as extending the semantics of the language.
variables cannot be redeclared with let or const, and variables declared with const cannot be reassigned.
let and const have block scope.

(transition to a more indepth look at each way of creating a variable)
